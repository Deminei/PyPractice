Notes:

- Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and readability.
- It emphasizes code readability and has a clean syntax that allows programmers to express concepts in fewer lines of code compared to other languages.
- Python supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming.

Variables:
- Variables are used to store data in memory for later use.
- In Python, you can assign a value to a variable using the assignment operator (=).
- Variables in Python are dynamically typed, meaning you don't need to declare their type explicitly.
- Variable names are case-sensitive and can consist of letters, numbers, and underscores. They cannot start with a number.

Data Types:
- Python has several built-in data types, including:
  - Numeric types: integers, floats, and complex numbers.
  - Sequence types: lists, tuples, and strings.
  - Mapping type: dictionary.
  - Boolean type: True or False.
  - None type: represents the absence of a value.
- You can use the `type()` function to determine the type of a variable.

Control Flow:
- Python provides control flow statements to alter the execution flow based on conditions and loops.
- The `if` statement is used for conditional execution. It allows you to specify different blocks of code to be executed based on certain conditions.
- The `for` loop is used to iterate over a sequence (such as a list or a string) or any iterable object.
- The `while` loop is used to repeatedly execute a block of code as long as a certain condition is true.
- The `break` and `continue` statements allow you to control the flow within loops.

Functions:
- Functions are blocks of reusable code that perform a specific task.
- They allow you to break your code into logical units, making it more modular and easier to maintain.
- Functions can take input parameters (arguments) and return output values.
- In Python, you define a function using the `def` keyword followed by the function name, parentheses for parameters, and a colon to indicate the start of the function block.

Basic Scripting:
- Python can be used for writing scripts to automate tasks or perform specific operations.
- A Python script is a plain text file with a `.py` extension that contains Python code.
- You can execute a Python script by running the `python` command followed by the script filename.
- Python scripts can include variable assignments, control flow statements, function calls, and more.
